# RefillableAmmoBags

PayDay 2 BLT Mod

Keeps track of ammo picked up over maximum, eventually filling an ammo bag with the extra.

Formula is (Ammo bag size  * total weapon ammo) for both Primary and Secondary. 
Once they are both above the threshold, it adds an Ammo bag if you have them equipped.

Comes with 2 settings, both **ON** by Default:
- grabWhenFull : You can grab ammo even when your gun is full, with all of it going to the cache
- focusSupport : Half of all ammo picked up goes towards the cache

NOTE: This marks you as a cheater if you place over 2 bags total during a heist. I have no clue how to fix this
